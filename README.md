# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This project showcases a collection of fundamental **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms**, all implemented **from scratch** without the use of external libraries. The project covers both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques and serves as a great introduction to key ML concepts.

## Overview

The repository contains implementations of the following algorithms and techniques:

- **Supervised Learning**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Implemented using gradient descent and closed-form solution.
  - **Kernel Regression**: An extension of linear regression using kernel tricks.
  - **Decision Tree**: A basic implementation of a decision tree algorithm for classification tasks.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple yet powerful algorithm for classification based on distance metrics.
  - **Perceptron**: A fundamental neural network algorithm used for binary classification.

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into clusters based on distance from centroids.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique to transform data into a lower-dimensional space.
  - **Kernel PCA**: A non-linear version of PCA using the kernel trick to handle non-linear data.

- **Distributions**:
  - **Beta Distribution**: A probability distribution that is useful in modeling variables constrained to intervals of finite length in applications like Bayesian statistics.
  - **Gaussian (Normal) Distribution**: One of the most widely used probability distributions, representing data that follows a bell-shaped curve.

## Features

- **No External Libraries**: All algorithms are implemented from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of their inner workings.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: The code is structured in a way that each algorithm is self-contained and easily understandable.
- **Educational**: Aimed at students, researchers, or anyone wanting to learn how core ML algorithms function.
- **Easy to Follow**: Well-commented code for clarity, making it simple to follow along and grasp the underlying concepts.
